# MeowMeow ATM

This is a python project that models a banking system, with the GUI developed using Tkinter 
and the persistance data created using shelve.


The interface includes:
* A GUI that simulates a bank machine, allowing a user to view their account info, withdraw and deposit
  from their accounts.
* A Bank Management CLI that allows a teller to add and delete users and accounts0, 
  as well as run reports.
* Transaction logging
* Login and user authentication
